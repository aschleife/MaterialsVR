# MaterialsVR

MaterialsVR lets you interact with molecular models in Virtual Reality. Add planes to create cross section. See electron density isosurfaces and load your own CHGCAR files.
## Features
### Toolbar
Start by selecting a molecule from the menu. Each model is accompanied by a toolbar above. Use it to enable rotation, disable bounding box, or add a plane that intersects with the molecule.

| Button     | Description                                                                                                                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rotation   | Let the entire model start rotating at a constant speed                                                                                    |
| Add Plane  | Add a semitransparent intersecting plane to the model. It can be deleted or set as the cross section plane (only render model on one side) |
| Bound box  | Enable the bounding box to move/rotate/adjust the size of the model. Disable the bounding box to look up atom names.                       |
| Polyhedral | Toggle polyhedral view (on select models)                                                                                                  |
| Delete     | Remove the model                                                                                                                           |
| Sliders    | Adjust the atom size or isosurface level (only on isosurface models)                                                                       |

Click on "Tool Tips" to show more insights.
### Cross Section View
You can set a plane to be the cross section plane by clicking the button on top. Only meshes on one side of the plane will be rendered.
### Electron density isosurfaces
Click on the "Molecule" title bar to switch to isosurface list. From there, you may select a isosurface model generated from CHGCAR files. You can modify the isosurface level in the toolbar.
